# Advanced Deep Learning Methods for Healthcare

by Université de l'Illinois à Urbana-Champaign

**À propos de ce cours**

This course covers deep learning (DL) methods, healthcare data and applications using DL methods. The courses include activities such as video lectures, self guided programming labs, homework assignments (both written and programming), and a large project.



Week 1 - Attention Models

Attention Models are useful to detect specific features in a data source. We'll explain how it can be applied to the risk of heart failure.


Week 2 - Graph Neural Networks

In this week we'll explain the fundamentals of Graph Neural Networks.


Week 3 - Memory Networks

We'll explain the principles behind Memory Networks and how they can be used for predictions in medical applications.


Week 4 - Generative Models

We'll discuss Generative Networks, as well as the method of Variational Autoencoder
